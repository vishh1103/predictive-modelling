    "## Introduction\n",
    "Elections are critical events that determine policy directions and the allocation of public resources. Governments and citizens alike are interested in understanding which factors contribute to a successful ballot measure (e.g., tax levies, bond measures). With the growth of publicly available election data, we can leverage Machine Learning to predict election outcomes based on historical patterns and feature relationships.\n",
    "This project aims to develop an end-to-end predictive modeling pipeline that can forecast the pass/fail outcome of election measures based on various features like vote percentages, measure type, election type, amount of tax/bond proposed, and more. The final solution is deployed as an interactive Streamlit app for easy usability by non-technical stakeholders."

    "% Yes and % No votes\n",

    "Amount of Bond/Tax\n",
    "\n",
    "Agency County, Election Type, Type of Tax/Debt, etc.\n",

    "## Project Outcome\n",
    "The project followed a complete ML pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Data Preparation:\n",
    "Cleaned missing values and inconsistent formats (e.g., dollar signs in tax amounts)\n",
    "\n",
    "Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "Converted the target (Result (Pass/Fail)) into a binary label\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Model Training:\n",
    "Used Random Forest Classifier due to its robustness and interpretability\n",
    "\n",
    "Applied train-test split with stratification to ensure balanced class distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluated model using accuracy and classification report\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Streamlit App Deployment:\n",
    "Built an interactive frontend using Streamlit\n",
    "\n",
    "Allowed users to input key features through sidebar UI\n",
    "\n",
    "App preprocessed the input, scaled it, and predicted the election result\n",
    "\n",
    "Displayed the prediction and class probabilities (Pass/Fail)\n",
